The aim of this project is to explore and deconstruct historical female beauty standards through the lens of classical art. A diverse art database of around 50 works was curated from sources like ArtStor, WikiArt, and various Museum databases. Then, the TensorFlow.js library BodyPix was applied to each image, using machine learning and computer vision to accurately segment bodies.

Done as my Senior Project for completion of my computer science degree under Professor Julie Dorsey in the Fall of 2020. The final report can be read [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YHNzm82DjMAa5YKwzSeq_hCLjXI5ca97t-K54ABf8Zs/view).
